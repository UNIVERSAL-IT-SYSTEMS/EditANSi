;  ANSI graphics and BBSes. Also credits to Eric "xzip" Knutsson for his
;  moral support on all the nostalgic BBS journeys I set course on.

;  I actually got use of this in 2011 when creating the arts for price
;  tickets at Birdie 21 in Uppsala. Sometimes it's fun with nostalgia.
;
;  Do whatever you want with the code and/or binaries.
